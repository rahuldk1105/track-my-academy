# Track My Academy - Project Status

## Overview
Track My Academy is a comprehensive SaaS platform for sports academy management. The system provides admin-controlled academy creation, demo request management, and real-time system monitoring capabilities.

## Recent Changes Completed

### 1. âœ… CRITICAL BUG FIX - Player Display Issue Resolution
**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**
- **Issue**: Players were being created successfully but not displaying in the academy dashboard players tab
- **Root Cause**: Academy users existed in Supabase authentication but had no corresponding academy records in MongoDB, causing 403 "No academy associated with this user" errors on GET /api/academy/players
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Created missing academy records in MongoDB and properly linked to Supabase users
  - Fixed missing Supabase dependencies (supabase-auth, deprecation, websockets, supabase-functions)
  - Verified proper academy_id linkage across all player management operations
- **Testing Results**: Successfully created and retrieved 5 test players with correct data isolation
- **Impact**: Academy dashboard now displays all players correctly in the players tab

### 2. âœ… Academy-Specific Branding Implementation  
**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**
- **Feature**: Academy logos now display prominently in each academy's dashboard header
- **Implementation**: Enhanced AcademyDashboard header layout with:
  - Prominent academy logo display (larger size, professional styling)
  - Academy name and "Academy Portal" branding
  - Fallback to default logo if academy logo not available
  - Improved visual hierarchy and user experience
- **Scope**: Academy-specific branding in academy dashboard (super admin dashboard retains "Track My Academy" branding)
- **UI Improvements**: Professional card-style logo container with better spacing and typography

### 3. âœ… Enhanced Player Management System
**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**
- **Backend APIs**: All CRUD operations fully functional and tested
  - POST /api/academy/players - Create players with validation
  - GET /api/academy/players - Retrieve academy-specific players  
  - PUT /api/academy/players/{id} - Update player information
  - DELETE /api/academy/players/{id} - Remove players
- **Data Isolation**: Proper academy_id linkage ensures data security
- **Validation**: Registration number uniqueness, field validation, age auto-calculation
- **Stats Integration**: Real-time player counts in overview dashboard

### 4. Dynamic System Overview Implementation
**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**
- **Backend**: Added `/api/admin/system-overview` endpoint with comprehensive real-time data
- **Models**: Created SystemStats, RecentActivity, RecentAcademy, and SystemOverview models

  - Real-time statistics (total academies, active academies, pending academies, demo requests)
  - Recent activity tracking (academy registrations, demo requests)
  - Recently added academies display
  - Server status monitoring
  - Interactive quick actions with live counts

### 2. Removed Individual User Addition Feature
**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**
- **Removed**: "Add New User" button from the User Management tab
- **Rationale**: Focus on academy-based user management only
- **Updated UI**: Added descriptive subtitle for user management section

### 3. Demo Request System Verification
**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**
- **Backend Testing**: All demo request endpoints working correctly
  - POST `/api/demo-requests` - Creates new demo requests
  - GET `/api/admin/demo-requests` - Retrieves demo requests for admin
  - PUT `/api/admin/demo-requests/{id}` - Updates demo request status
- **Frontend Integration**: Demo request modal properly connected
- **Database**: MongoDB integration confirmed working

### 4. Enhanced Data Synchronization
**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**
- **Real-time Updates**: System overview refreshes when academies are created
- **Data Consistency**: Both academy stats and system overview update simultaneously
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for all dynamic content
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states with retry functionality
